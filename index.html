				<h2 >About Possible</h2>
				<div class="myAbout">
				<p>After graduating from college,I literally did nothing with my degree.
				</p>
				<p>Being a business man at that time,i couldn't give myself any attention to software until I came accross Ramadan who opened my eyes to see the importance of software. This is how I came to know about the most pushful and powerful site <a href="https://www.thinkful.com">(thinkful)</a>that keeps me in this field of interest.This way I can better upgrate my business online by developing websites.</p>
				<p>With that said,my <i>attention to details</i> grew together with my <i>communication</i> and <i>problem solving skills</i> that led to <i>coding down this knowledge</i> not only for my benefit but to all that it may be of help. I am super interested in building new skills,I will be glad to join a team that continues paving the way forward. Below are my contact dedtails.</p>
